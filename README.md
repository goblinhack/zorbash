How to build
------------

- On Linux: (Ubuntu 22.10, Fedora 37 + Python 3.11)
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME
</pre>
- On MacOS (needs Mac Ports/Homebrew).
- Does not work with anaconda (help wanted as I do not use anaconda):
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME
</pre>
- Docker (experimental, it builds but cannot find a video display):
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME.docker.ubuntu
    sh ./RUNME.docker.fedora
    sh ./RUNME.docker.debian
</pre>
- On Windows (todo)
<!-- - On Windows (todo): (install msys2 first via https://www.msys2.org/) -->
<!-- <pre>                                                                 -->
<!--     sh ./RUNME.windows.mingw64                                        -->
<!-- </pre>                                                                -->

Hardware Specs
--------------
The game should run fine on low end PCs, a half decent graphics card and
likely > 4g of RAM. If graphics is a limitation, you could run it in ascii
mode. I'd be interested in knowing of any low end specs that people get
this PC working on.

Dependancies
------------
OpenGL, SDL2 and Python3 (tested up to 3.11) is needed.
