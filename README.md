How to build
------------

Linux
=====
- Tested on Ubuntu 22.10
- Tested on Fedora 37
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME
</pre>

Windows
=======
- Tested on Windows 10
- Please install msys2 first via https://www.msys2.org/
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME
</pre>

Macos
=====
- Install Mac Ports/Homebrew first.
- Does not work with anaconda (help wanted as I do not use anaconda):
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME
</pre>

Docker
======
- Docker (experimental, it builds but cannot find a video display):
<pre>
    sh ./RUNME.docker.ubuntu
    sh ./RUNME.docker.fedora
    sh ./RUNME.docker.debian
</pre>

Hardware Specs
--------------
The game should run fine on low end PCs, a half decent graphics card and
likely > 4g of RAM. If graphics is a limitation, you could run it in ascii
mode. I'd be interested in knowing of any low end specs that people get
this PC working on.

Dependancies
------------
OpenGL, SDL2 and Python3 (tested up to 3.11) is needed.

<!-- In days of old, The Zorbashian Empire discovered the Earth and they wrought much rage -->
<!-- upon her verdant soils. Their wrath was mighty and left the world scarred and in darkness. -->

<!-- Those that remain, scavenge amongst the ruins of once great cities. Religious zealotry -->
<!-- has taken hold and all technology is viewed as demonic magic and forbidden. To be found -->
<!-- with Zorbashian tech is a death sentence. -->

<!-- Your task, nobel one, is only to survive, for in surviving we continue to resist. -->
<!-- If you are able to strike a blow against the Zorbashian demons then seek out their -->
<!-- many underground bases. It is from here they spawn from their far off realm. But -->
<!-- beware, they have many dread beasts guarding their bases. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- Legend says that there is a master base somewhere, where the Emperor Zorbash resides. -->
<!-- Whether this is true or not, cannot be said but to strike at the heart of their rule -->
<!-- may be enough to drive the Zorbashians out. And then we can be free again. -->

<!--                       A deadly lure to tempt all those -->
